# spwm_400Hz_
This project is the designing and implementation of 24V to 115, 125, 400Hz SPWM inverter to convert the direct current to alternating current. Such as what can be continuous from a standard wall outlet. There are generally three types of the inverter in general purpose: modified sine wave, pure sine wave, and square wave. Considering the power output capability, efficiency and harmonics pure sine wave inverter is the best quality among these three types of the inverter. The main goal of this project is generating a pure sine wave. In this design, the inverter converts the low voltage 24V DC power to 115V DC source of high voltage. It also converts high DC source into AC waveform identical to sine wave using PWM generated by microcontroller. The crux of this research work is the use of an economical and advanced 16-bit PIC microcontroller to generate the popular SPWM with very high carrier frequency (in order of kHz) to control the inverter circuit. The high frequency pulses of SPWM results in smoothed filtration of inverter output into pure sine wave by using small sized capacitors and inductors as a filter. This inverter circuit provides a pure sine wave of 400Hz frequency with low harmonic distortion. The simulation is done by MATLAB/SIMULINK software in the beginning step. Finally, it's implemented and tested in real time basis.
